Introduction

LearnHub is a front-end mini project developed using HTML5 and CSS3. The project represents a simple and clean landing page for an online learning platform. It was created as part of an academic mini project to apply theoretical knowledge of web development into a practical, real-world website design.

The focus of this project is on building a well-structured layout, maintaining visual consistency, and ensuring a responsive user experience without using JavaScript or external libraries.

Project Overview

The LearnHub website is designed to resemble a basic e-learning platform interface. It includes commonly used sections such as a navigation bar, a hero section, course categories, testimonials, and a footer. Each section is carefully designed to keep the layout clean, readable, and user-friendly.

This project helped in understanding how individual HTML elements come together to form a complete web page and how CSS can be used to control layout, colors, spacing, and overall appearance.
